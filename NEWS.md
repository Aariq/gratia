# gratia 0.3.99 (in development)

## New features

* `draw.gam()` can now include partial residuals when drawing univariate smooths.
  Use `residuals = TRUE` to add partial residuals to each univariate smooth that
  is drawn. This feature is not available for smooths of more than one variable,
  by smooths, or factor-smooth interactions (`bs = "fs"`).

* New functions `add_fitted()` and `add_residuals()` to add fitted values
  (expectations) and model residuals to an existing data frame. Currently methods
  available for objects fitted by `gam()` and `bam()`.

* `smooth_samples()` can handle continuous by variable smooths such as in
  varying coefficient models.

* `evaluate_smooth()`, `data_slice()`, `family()`, `link()`, `inv_link()` methods
  for models fitted using `gamm4()` from the **gamm4** package.

* `data_slice()` can generate data for a 1-d slice (a single variable varying).

* The colour of the points, reference lines, and simulation band in `appraise()`
  can now be specified via arguments

    * `point_col`,
    * `point_alpha`,
    * `ci_col`
    * `ci_alpha`
    * `line_col`

  These are passed on to `qq_plot()`, `observed_fitted_plot()`,
  `residuals_linpred_plot()`, and `residuals_hist_plot()`, which also now take
  the new arguments were applicable.

* Added utility functions `is_factor_term()` and `term_variables()` for working
  with models. `is_factor_term()` identifies is the named term is a factor using
  information from the `terms()` object of the fitted model. `term_variables()`
  returns a character vector of variable names that are involved in a model
  term. These are strictly for working with parametric terms in models.

## User visible changes

* `datagen()` is now an *internal* function and is no longer exported. Use
  `data_slice()` instead.

* `evaluate_parametric_terms()` is now much stricter and can only evaluate main
  effect terms, i.e. those whose order, as stored in the `terms` object of the
  model is `1`.

## Bug fixes

* The `draw()` method for `derivatives()` was not getting the x-axis label for
  factor by smooths correctly, and instead was using `NA` for the second and
  subsequent levels of the factor.

* The `datagen()` method for class `"gam"` couldn't possibly have worked for
  anything but the simplest models and would fail even with simple factor by
  smooths. These issues have been fixed, but the behaviour of `datagen()` has
  changed, and the function is now not intended for use by users.

* Fixed an issue where in models terms of the form `factor1:factor2` were
  incorrectly identified as being numeric parametric terms.

# gratia 0.3.1

## New features

* New functions `link()` and `inv_link()` to access the link function and its
  inverse from fitted models and family functions.
  
  Methods for classes: `"glm"`, `"gam"`, `"bam"`, `"gamm"` currently.
  [#58](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/58)

* Adds explicit `family()` methods for objects of classes `"gam"`, `"bam"`, and
  `"gamm"`.

* `derivatives()` now handles non-numeric when creating shifted data for finite
  differences. Fixes a problem with `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` default in R-devel.

## Bug fixes

* Updated *gratia* to work with *tibble* versions >= 3.0

# gratia 0.3.0

## New features

* *gratia* now uses the *mvnfast* package for random draws from a multivariate
  normal distribution (`mvnfast::rmvn()`). Contributed by Henrik Singmann (@singmann)
  [#28](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/28)

* New function `basis()` for generating tidy representations of basis expansions
  from an *mgcv*-like definition of a smooth, e.g. `s()`, `te()`, `ti()`, or
  `t2()`. The basic smooth types also have a simple `draw()` method for plotting
  the basis. `basis()` is a simple wrapper around `mgcv::smoothCon()` with some
  post processing of the basis model matrix into a tidy format. [#42](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/42)

* New function `smooth_samples()` to draw samples of entire smooth functions from
  their posterior distribution. Also has a `draw()` method for plotting the
  posterior samples.

## Bug fixes

* `draw.gam()` would produce empty plots between the panels for the parametric
    terms if there were 2 or more parametric terms in a model. Reported by
    @sklayn [#39](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/39).

* `derivatives()` now works with factor by smooths, including ordered factor by
    smooths. The function also now works correctly for complex models with
    multiple covariates/smooths. [#47](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/47)

    `derivatives()` also now handles `'fs'` smooths.  Reported by
    @tomand-uio [#57](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/57).

* `evaluate_parametric_term()` and hence `draw.gam()` would fail on a `ziplss()` model
  because i) *gratia* didn't handle parametric terms in models with multiple linear
  predictors correctly, and ii) *gratia* didn't convert to the naming convention of
  *mgcv* for terms in higher linear predictors. Reported by @pboesu [#45](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia/issues/45).
